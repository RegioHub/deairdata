\title{Get air quality data}
\usage{
air_quality(date_from, time_from, date_to, time_to, station = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{date_from}{A date ("YYYY-MM-DD", required only for use = "airquality")}

\item{time_from}{An hour (1..24)}

\item{date_to}{A date ("YYYY-MM-DD", required only for use = "airquality")}

\item{time_to}{An hour (1..24)}

\item{station}{ID of the station to get data from. If \code{NULL}, get data from
all available stations.}
}
\value{
A named list where the names are station IDs and each element is a

corresponding station with 5 columns:
\itemize{
\item start_dttm, end_dttm: Time of start and end of measuring in CET
\item index: Airquality index for all components
\item is_incomplete: Flag if data is incomplete (not all components available)
\item data: List column of data frames with the measured components
\itemize{
\item component: Component ID
\item value: Measured value for this component
\item index: Airquality index of this component
\item pct_in_index_thresholds: Decimal representation of percent in index
thresholds. 0.x is x percent between index 0 and 1, 1.x is x percent
between index 1 and 2 etc.
